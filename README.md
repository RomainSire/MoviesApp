# MoviesApp
Displays current trending movies.  

The App uses jQuery and AJAX to request a JSON answer from the API [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)  
There is only one HTML page, and everything is managed by JavaScript.  
This app was coded during my trainee at the educational establishments [3W Academy](https://3wa.fr/). The code I publish here is my own, before checking the way of coding of this establishment.

## Ways of improving the app
- Currently not responsive, has to be done.
- Add other default movies searches, such as :
  * filter by year
  * add TV shows and dramas not only movies
  * more different genres filters
  * etc...
- Pagination
